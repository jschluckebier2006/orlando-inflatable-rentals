      <p>
        The origins of <strong>Christmas, Florida</strong> can be traced back to the Second 
        Seminole War in the 1830s. In December 1837, the U.S. Army established a small outpost 
        called <strong>Fort Christmas</strong> as a base for supplies and soldiers during the 
        conflict with the Seminole tribes. The fort was constructed about 20 miles east of what 
        is now Orlando, in an area that offered natural defenses of wetlands and forest.

      <p>
        After the war ended in 1842, Fort Christmas was abandoned for several years. However, 
        in the late 1840s, settlers began arriving in the area to take advantage of the fertile 
        soil and mild climate. A tiny village sprung up around the remains of the old fort, 
        adopting the name Christmas in honor of the former outpost.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the first permanent residents were several American pioneer families including 
        the Jacksons, Taylors, and Overstreets. These settlers established farms, cattle ranches, 
        and pine timber operations in the surrounding countryside. A post office was set up in 
        1853, officially putting Christmas on the map.

      <h2>Growth and Turmoil (1860s-1890s)</h2>

      <p>
        Like many Florida towns, Christmas experienced hardship during the Civil War years as 
        many men went off to fight and supplies were disrupted. In 1865, a small skirmish 
        occurred just west of the settlement when Union troops from Jacksonville battled a 
        Confederate force, though no buildings were damaged in Christmas itself.

      <p>
        After the war, growth resumed slowly but steadily. The arrival of the Fairbank brothers 
        from New York in the 1870s boosted the local sugar cane industry. A wood mill was built 
        along Fort Christmas Creek to process timber coming from the Econlockhatchee River 
        basin area.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the town was thrown into crisis in 1888 with the arrival of the Yellow Fever 
        epidemic sweeping Florida that year. Several residents perished from the dreaded 
        mosquito-borne illness, decimating the small population. It took years for Christmas 
        to recover from this calamity.
      </p>

      <h2>Rise as Tourist Attraction (1900s-Present)</h2>

      <p>
        As the 20th century began, Christmas' population and economy revived, centered around 
        citrus, sugar and timber operations. But a new direction emerged when residents started 
        encouraging tourists to visit and mail letters from the Christmas, FL post office as 
        a novelty experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first Holiday Tour of Homes event was held in 1933, where residents opened up their 
        decorative Christmas-themed houses to the public. This tradition exploded in popularity 
        through the years. In 1969, the street names were changed to holiday themed titles like 
        Reindeer Road and Snowman Trail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, Christmas has fully leaned into its holiday persona, going all-out with zany 
        decorations, themed stores and annual Christmas events. While only about 1,000 permanent 
        residents call Christmas home, tens of thousands of tourists visit each year to 
        experience the weird, wonderful sights and holiday cheer on display year-round in this 
        quirky little town.
